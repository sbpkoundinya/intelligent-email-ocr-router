## ðŸ“§ Intelligent Email Classifier Backend (FastAPI)

This repository contains a robust and scalable FastAPI backend solution designed to intelligently classify incoming emails, perform OCR-based data extraction, detect duplicates, and automate routing decisions. It is tailored especially for financial institutions to enhance customer service operations and streamline loan servicing workflows.

Whether an email has a body, attachment, or both, this system uses advanced machine learning models and customizable rules to:
- Categorize the email into a **Request Type** and **Sub-request Type**.
- Decide the **Priority Source** (Email Body, Attachment, or Both).
- Extract critical structured data (e.g., loan numbers, amounts).
- Flag potential duplicates with reasoning.
- Recommend or automatically route the request to the correct team.
